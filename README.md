# AdventOfCode2021 By Taimander

This is a repository where I'll try to put all my attempts at AoC 2021.

I'll try doing all I can on C++, because its a languange that I know that I only
know the basics, but I still need to get some practice on it. So I'll try my
best to keep doing all days on C++.

If there is a day that I can't do in C++, I might do it on java or python, because
those are the languages I am the most proficient on.

Don't come here for detailed, well made code, this is just to keep an archive of
my code. I don't really want to do well documented, optimized or fancy code.
Just some code to learn the language.

Also, I don't really want any improvements on the code, so please don't pull request.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy AoC and also the mess my code might get once the challenges
start getting harder. :)
